SWE Project: A CLI for Trustworthy Pre-Trained Model Re-Use
This project is a command-line interface (CLI) developed for ACME Corporation to help their service engineering teams evaluate and choose trustworthy, pre-trained AI/ML models from open-source ecosystems like Hugging Face. 



The tool analyzes model repositories from various URLs (Hugging Face, GitHub) and calculates a series of quality and trustworthiness metrics. It outputs a final weighted "Net Score" for each model, allowing engineers to quickly assess its suitability for re-use in ACME's products, which are licensed under LGPLv2.1. 





## Features & Metrics
The CLI evaluates models based on several key metrics, each contributing to a final "Net Score":


üìà Performance Claims: Assesses the evidence of a model's performance claims by checking for benchmarks and evaluation results in its metadata. 



‚öñÔ∏è License: Checks the model's license for compatibility with ACME's open-source policies (LGPLv2.1).  It scores based on whether the license is compatible, incompatible, or unclear.




‚è±Ô∏è Ramp-Up Time: Uses an LLM to analyze the model's README.md file to determine the effort required for an engineer to start using the model ("ramp-up time"). 




üöå Bus Factor: Measures the concentration of knowledge among contributors to the model's codebase to assess project risk and maintainability. 




üíª Code Quality: Evaluates the quality of the associated codebase by checking for dependency files (e.g., requirements.txt) and the proportion of Python files. 



üì¶ Dataset & Code Availability: Scores the model based on whether it links to datasets, provides source code, and includes demos (Hugging Face Spaces). 



üìä Dataset Quality: Assesses the quality of any associated datasets by checking for documentation, download counts, and data viewer availability. 


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python 3.x

An environment variable 

GITHUB_TOKEN containing a valid GitHub Personal Access Token for API requests. 

### Installation
To install all the necessary Python dependencies, run the following command from the root of the repository:

Bash

./run install
This command will install all required packages into your user environment. 

## Usage
### Running the Analysis
To analyze models, provide a text file containing a newline-delimited list of URLs. These URLs can point to Hugging Face models, datasets, or GitHub repositories. 

Execute the tool with the following command:

Bash

./run /path/to/your/url_file.txt
The program will process the URLs and print the results to standard output in NDJSON format. Each line will contain a JSON object with the calculated scores and latencies for a single model. 



### Running Tests
The project includes a test suite to ensure correctness and stability. To run the tests, use the following command:

Bash

./run test
The output will report the number of test cases passed and the overall line coverage percentage. The test suite requires at least 80% coverage to pass. 


### Logging
The application generates logs to help with debugging and monitoring. Logging behavior is controlled by two environment variables:


$LOG_FILE: The absolute path to the log file. 


$LOG_LEVEL: The verbosity level for logging. 

0: Silent (default)

1: Informational messages

2: Debug messages
